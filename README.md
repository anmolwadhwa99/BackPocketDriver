This project involved developing an Android application and a RESTful web-service to help encourage safe driving among the youth. The Android application would take regulary readings of the driver's location and speed while they were driving and send this information to the web-service. The web-service would store all this data in its database. Once the driver finishing driving, they were able to view statistics associated with their driving (on the Android app) such as speed, distance and duration in certain types of conditions. This would help them reflect on their driving and understand where they were going wrong and how they could improve.
